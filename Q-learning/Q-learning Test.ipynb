    "Suppose we have 5 rooms in a building connected by doors as shown in the figure below.  We'll number each room 0 through 4.  The outside of the building can be thought of as one big room (5).  Notice that doors 1 and 4 lead into the building from room 5 (outside). For this example, we'd like to put an agent in any room, and from that room, go outside the building (this will be our target room). In other words, the goal room is number 5. \n",
