    "In natural language processing, perplexity is a way of evaluating language models(a probability distribution over entire sentences or texts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition 1\n",
    "$$PP(S)=P(W_{1}W_{2}\\dots W_{N})^{-\\frac{1}{N}}=\\sqrt[N]{\\frac{1}{P(W_{1}W_{2}\\dots W_{N})}}$$\n",
    "Lower perplexity suggests higher probability of the sentence.\n",
    "In bigram model, we have\n",
    "$$PP(S)=\\sqrt[N]{\\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(W_{i}|W_{i-1})}}$$\n",
    "Where $W_{0}$ indicates the START label. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a fair 10-sided die is rolled for $N$ times, asssume that the results are iid, by definition we have\n",
    "$$PP(S)=\\sqrt[N]{\\frac{1}{\\prod_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{1}{10}}}=10$$. Intuitively, for a language model with a certain perplexity, say, 100, it indicates that at each point there are 100 candidates for its prediction by average."

    "### Definition 2\n",
    "A model of an unknown probability distribution $p$, may be proposed based on a training sample that was drawn from $p$. Given a proposed probability model $q$, one may evaluate $q$ by asking how well it predicts a separate test sample $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$,$\\dots$ , $x_{N}$ also drawn from $p$. The perplexity of the model $q$ is defined as\n",
    "$$b^{-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\log_{b}q(x_{i})}$$, where $b$ is customarily $2$. Better models $q$ of the unknown distribution $p$ will tend to assign higher probabilities $q(x_{i})$ to the test events. Thus, they have lower perplexity: they are less surprised by the test sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponent above may be regarded as the average number of bits needed to represent a test event $x_{i}$ if one uses an optimal code based on $q$. Low-perplexity models do a better job of compressing the test sample, requiring few bits per test element on average because $q(x_{i})$ tends to be high."
